    "a misspelled keyword, a missing colon, \n",

    "3. Exceptions are errors that occur during execution, which means that Python can\n",

    "such as dividing by zero, accessing a non-existent key in a dictionary, or importing\n",
    "a module that does not exist12. Exceptions are not necessarily fatal, as they can be \n",

    "ans :  When an exception is not handled in Python, it causes the current process to stop and passes it to the calling process until it is handled³. If not handled, the program will crash and produce some information called Traceback⁴. Traceback shows the details of the exception, such as the type of the exception, the message associated with the exception, and the line number where the exception occurred⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider this code that tries to divide a number by zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    return x / y\n",
    "\n",
    "num1 = 10\n",
    "num2 = 0\n",
    "result = divide(num1, num2)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will raise a ZeroDivisionError exception, which is not handled by the divide() function or the main program. Therefore, the program will terminate and display this Traceback:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 7, in <module>\n",
    "    result = divide(num1, num2)\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 2, in divide\n",
    "    return x / y\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the Traceback shows the type of the exception (ZeroDivisionError), the message associated with the exception (division by zero), and the line number where the exception occurred (line 2 in divide() function and line 7 in main program).\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent the program from crashing, you can handle the exception using try/except/finally statements¹²⁴. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        return x / y\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "\n",
    "num1 = 10\n",
    "num2 = 0\n",
    "result = divide(num1, num2)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will catch and handle the ZeroDivisionError exception in the except clause and print a message instead of crashing. The finally clause can be used to execute some code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not¹²⁴. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        return x / y\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        print(\"This is executed always\")\n",
    "\n",
    "num1 = 10\n",
    "num2 = 0\n",
    "result = divide(num1, num2)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
